# Ben's Ethereum stuff

## The Main Things

  - Since February 2024 I have been at [OP Labs](https://www.oplabs.co/), scaling the world computer.
  - I am founder and erstwhile product owner for the [Teku](https://github.com/Consensys/teku) Ethereum consensus client at [Consensys](https://consensys.net/). I joined Consensys in October 2017, spending the first two years building the fabulous PegaSys R&D team before moving over to the product side to bring Teku to life.
  - I am writing the definitive technical book on Ethereum's proof of stake protocol. It's called [Upgrading Ethereum](https://eth2book.info/), or sometimes just "The Eth2 Book". At last count, around 135,000 words of my own, and 367 pages in the [PDF version](https://eth2book.info/latest/book.pdf).
  - I wrote 100 fortnightly editions of ["What's new in Eth2?"](https://eth2.news) in the four year run-up to The Merge.
  - My [greatest Tweet](https://twitter.com/benjaminion_xyz/status/1446516207159582743) (so far). My [least deserved Tweet](https://twitter.com/josephdelong/status/1708822183319855158).

## Other writing

  - A little of my [crypto origin story](https://consensys.io/blog/devs-behind-the-merge-ben-edgington-teku-product-lead).
  - [The Eth2 Annotated Specification](https://benjaminion.xyz/eth2-annotated-spec/phase0/beacon-chain/). Vitalik [likes it](https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1287734918823456781) 😀 (this was the precursor to [The Book](https://eth2book.info/latest/)).
  - Explainers:
    - [BLS12-381 for the Rest of Us](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/bls12-381), a (moderately) accessible description of elliptic curve construction, focusing on BLS12-381. There's a lot in there.
      - (Generous endorsements from [Mihailo Bjelic](https://twitter.com/MihailoBjelic/status/1215269758112817153) and [Alex Stokes](https://x.com/ralexstokes/status/1767679340307702110), and a reference in footnote 1 of [this paper](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/339.pdf) by no less than Jens Groth 🎉)
    - An explainer and toy example of the [data recovery](https://hackmd.io/@benjaminion/data_recovery) scheme we plan to use in Eth2.
    - Other things have mostly been folded into [The Book](https://eth2book.info/latest/) now.

## Code

Although I write quite a lot of code for my own use, I am not fundamentally a "dev". I wrote a chunk of Teku in its early days (especially for the cryptography layer), but most of that has now been superseded by proper code and professional cryptographic libraries.

  - [c-kzg](https://github.com/benjaminion/c-kzg) - a library for polynomial commitments and data recovery for use in Eth sharding. Parts of this have been [adopted](https://github.com/ethereum/c-kzg-4844) officially for the Cancun&ndash;Deneb EIP-4844 upgrade.
